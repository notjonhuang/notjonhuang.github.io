## About me...

Hello! I'm Jon, a physician-scientist in training in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Northwestern University.

My research focuses on developing, integrating, and evaluating generative AI models that improve real clinical workflows. Some of these models are used to support medical imaging interpretation --- including x-rays and CT scans --- as part of routine clinical care across the Northwestern Medicine health system.

*Here, we can visualize the relevant portions of a chest x-ray as the model generates a radiology report (using model "attention maps").*

These models are [accelerating clinical care](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/06/new-ai-transforms-radiology-with-speed-accuracy-never-seen-before/), enabling radiologists to provide results to patients and clinicians more quickly without compromising diagnostic accuracy. They are also acting as a second pair of eyes for each imaging study, alerting physicians to life-threatening conditions such as lung cancer and pneumothorax which may have been overlooked.

*To detect life-threatening pneumothorax, or a collapsed lung, AI-generated reports are screened in real time and cross-referenced with clinical data to rapidly alert physicians.*

I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Northwestern in 2025, supervised by Dr. Mozziyar Etemadi. I graduated from Brown University in 2020, where I completed undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Neuroscience.
